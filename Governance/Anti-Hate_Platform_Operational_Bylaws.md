# The Operational Bylaws of the Global Anti-Hate Platform

**Purpose**: These Bylaws define the operational procedures, rules, and responsibilities necessary to execute the mission defined in the **[Charter](./Anti-Hate_Platform_Charter.md)** and the **[System Architecture](./Anti-Hate_Platform_System_Architecture_and_Rights.md)**.

## Chapter 1: The Trustee Lifecycle

### 1.1 Eligibility
To be eligible for nomination as a Trustee at any level, a candidate must:
1.  Be a verified human user of the platform.
2.  Have a "Reputation Score" above the minimum threshold (defined by the Global Council).
3.  Have no record of confirmed hate speech authorship or malicious behavior on the platform.
4.  Not be a currently paid employee of the platform (to ensure separation of powers).

### 1.2 Vetting Process ("The Path to Trust")
All candidates must pass the following vetting stages before appearing on a ballot:
1.  **Automated Screening ("The Glass House")**: The platform's own analysis tools shall scan the candidate's public social media history and platform activity. Any flags must be reviewed by the Ethics Committee.
2.  **Community Interrogation**: Candidates must participate in a public Q&A period (minimum 7 days) where they answer questions submitted by the community.
3.  **Disclosure**: Candidates must file a "Conflict of Interest" statement, disclosing any affiliations that could bias their judgment.

### 1.3 Election Protocols
1.  **Local Trustees**: Elected by direct vote of verified users within the Leaf Node's jurisdiction.
    *   *Voting System*: Ranked Choice Voting.
2.  **Regional Trustees**: Elected by the council of Local Trustees within the region.
3.  **National Trustees**: Elected by the council of Regional Trustees.
4.  **Global Trustees**: Elected by the council of National Trustees.
5.  **Quorum**: A valid election requires participation from at least 30% of eligible voters.

### 1.4 Terms of Office
1.  **Duration**: Trustees serve a term of 2 years.
2.  **Staggering**: Elections are staggered so that approximately 50% of seats are contested each year to ensure continuity.
3.  **Term Limits**: No Trustee may serve more than 3 consecutive terms at the same level.

### 1.5 Removal & Recall
1.  **Vote of No Confidence**: A Trustee may be removed by a 2/3 majority vote of their peer Council for violation of the **System Architecture** or Bylaws.
2.  **Recall Petition**: If 20% of a Trustee's constituency signs a petition, a special recall election must be held within 30 days.

## Chapter 2: Roles & Responsibilities

### 2.1 Trustees
*   **Content Adjudication**: Review "Potential Hate Speech" flagged by the system and vote to Confirm or Dismiss.
*   **Escalation**: Vote to escalate confirmed campaigns to the next hierarchical level.
*   **Policy Making**: Set local thresholds and define context-specific hate speech parameters (e.g., local slang).
*   **Oversight**: Audit the performance of the Executive branch and the accuracy of AI models.

### 2.2 Volunteers ("The Guardians")
*   **Moderation**: Assist in community management and forum moderation.
*   **Data Labeling**: Contribute to datasets for training AI models (subject to Trustee review).

*   **Infrastructure**: Ensure the platform is online, secure, and performant.
*   **Development**: Write and maintain the software code based on Trustee requirements.
*   **Legal**: Manage legal compliance and defend the platform's interests.
*   **Neutrality**: Employees must remain neutral in content disputes and cannot influence Trustee voting.

## Chapter 3: Decision Making Process

### 3.1 The Voting Flow
1.  **Trigger**: System flags content or User submits report.
2.  **Analysis**: AI generates a "Potential Hate Speech" score and confidence level.
3.  **Review**: Item appears in the Trustee Dashboard.
4.  **Vote**: Trustees vote Up (Confirm), Down (Dismiss), or Abstain.
5.  **Consensus**:
    *   *Simple Majority* required for confirmation.
    *   *Supermajority (2/3)* required for high-impact actions (e.g., public naming of a "Hate Manufacturer").

### 3.2 The Override
Trustees may, by simple majority vote, override any AI classification. This override is final and feeds back into the system to retrain the models (Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback).

### 3.3 Escalation
A Local Council may vote to escalate a case to the Regional Council if:
1.  The hate campaign spans multiple cities.
2.  The target is a figure of regional importance.
3.  The complexity requires higher-level resources.

## Chapter 4: Amendment Process

### 4.1 Living Document
These Bylaws may be amended to adapt to changing needs.
1.  **Proposal**: Any Trustee may propose an amendment.
2.  **Adoption**: Requires a 2/3 majority vote of the Global Trustee Council.
