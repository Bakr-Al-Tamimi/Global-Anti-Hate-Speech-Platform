# System Architecture & Rights of the Global Anti-Hate Platform

**Subservience to the Charter**
This document is the technical and structural implementation of the moral principles defined in the **[Charter of the Global Anti-Hate Speech Platform](./Anti-Hate_Platform_Charter.md)**. In any conflict between this document and the Charter, the Charter shall prevail.

**Preamble**
We, the contributors, trustees, and participants of the Global Anti-Hate Platform, establish this System Architecture to shield humanity from the organized manufacturing of hate. We recognize that hate speech is not merely an expression but a systemic weapon used to undermine human dignity. We commit ourselves to a system that is transparent, democratic, and sovereign, ensuring that the power to define and combat hate remains in the hands of the people, not algorithms or central authorities.

## Article I: Mission & Principles

### 1.1 The Mission
The sole mission of this platform is to identify, expose, and disrupt the deliberate and systematic "manufacturing of hate" that poisons global discourse and instigates real-world harm. We serve to empower international action through actionable intelligence and to foster transparency and accountability.

### 1.2 Core Values
1.  **Human Sovereignty**: Human judgment is supreme. Algorithms serve as tools for detection, but never as judges of truth.
2.  **Privacy & Dignity**: The right to privacy is fundamental. We protect the identity of whistleblowers and victims with absolute rigor.
3.  **Transparency**: Our processes, code, and governance must be open to audit. Trust is earned through visibility.
4.  **Democracy**: Power flows from the bottom up. Local communities define their own standards within the framework of universal human rights.

### 1.3 Non-Negotiables
1.  **Data Sovereignty**: Raw content collected by a local node shall *never* be transferred to a central server or another node without explicit legal authorization or emergency consensus. Only anonymized metadata and intelligence may flow upward.
2.  **No Algorithmic Censorship**: The platform shall never automatically delete, hide, or suppress content based solely on algorithmic analysis. All such actions require human Trustee validation.
3.  **Open Source**: The core software of the platform shall remain source-available to ensure public trust and security.

## Article II: The Rights of the Network

### 2.1 Node Autonomy
Every Local, Regional, and National node possesses the inherent right to operate autonomously. In the event of a network partition or disagreement with the central coordination body, a node may continue to function independently, serving its local community.

### 2.2 User Privacy & Anonymity
Any individual submitting evidence of hate speech (a "Whistleblower") has the absolute right to anonymity. The platform guarantees that no personally identifiable information (PII) of a whistleblower will be logged or shared without their explicit, informed consent.

### 2.3 Trustee Sovereignty
Elected Trustees have the sovereign right and duty to:
1.  Review and override any classification made by the platform's AI models.
2.  Introduce new topics or threats for analysis that the system may have missed.
3.  Vote to escalate or de-escalate issues within the hierarchy based on their judgment.

## Article III: The Structure of Power

### 3.1 The Hierarchy
The platform operates as a federation of four tiers:
1.  **Leaf Nodes (Local)**: The foundation. Responsible for data collection, initial analysis, and local Trustee voting.
2.  **Regional Nodes**: Responsible for aggregating local intelligence and identifying cross-city patterns.
3.  **National Nodes**: Responsible for national threat assessment and coordination.
4.  **Global Coordination Nodes**: Responsible for international pattern recognition and reporting to global bodies (e.g., UN).

### 3.2 Separation of Powers
To prevent abuse, power is divided among three branches:
1.  **The Legislative (Trustees)**: Elected representatives responsible for policy, content classification, and high-level decision-making.
2.  **The Executive (Operations)**: Paid employees and core volunteers responsible for maintaining the code, infrastructure, and security. They implement the will of the Trustees but cannot vote on content.
3.  **The Judicial (Ethics Committee)**: An independent body responsible for resolving disputes, interpreting this **System Architecture**, and overseeing Trustee conduct.

## Article IV: Ratification & Amendment

### 4.1 Ratification
This System Architecture shall take effect upon ratification by a 2/3 majority vote of the founding International Trustees.

### 4.2 Amendment
Amendments to this System Architecture require:
1.  A proposal passed by a 2/3 majority of the Global Trustee Council.
2.  Ratification by a simple majority of all National Trustee Councils.
