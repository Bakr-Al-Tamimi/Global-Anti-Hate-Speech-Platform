# **Global Anti-Hate Speech Platform (GAHSP)**

## **Source-Available Public Audit License (SAPAL) Version 1.0**

#### **Preamble**

This license governs the use of the source code, documentation, and all associated materials ("The Code") for the Global Anti-Hate Speech Platform ("The Platform").

The Platform is conceived as a crucial contribution to humanity's enduring struggle to champion good over evil. It is rooted in the profound understanding that manufactured hate represents a pervasive evil that seeks to undermine human dignity and connection. The Platform's fundamental goal is to shield humanity by identifying, exposing, and disrupting the systematic "manufacturing of hate".

This work has been made possible by its contributors, including the foundational contribution of **Bakr Husain Hassan Al-Tamimi, born 17/05/1966**, and who conceptualized this initiative and and provided it as a contribution to humanity for no commercial purpose and has affirmed no interest in making material profits from this work, dedicating it solely to this humanitarian goal.

This license is designed to enforce a critical distinction:

1.  **The Right to Audit (Permitted):** To foster transparency, accountability, and trust, The Code is made available for public inspection, security auditing, and algorithmic bias review.
2.  **The Right to Operate (Strictly Prohibited):** To prevent the platform from being weaponized by malicious actors, hate groups, or any entity outside its intended mandate, the right to run, deploy, or use The Code for data processing is explicitly forbidden for all parties except the single Designated Authority: **THE UNITED NATIONS**.
